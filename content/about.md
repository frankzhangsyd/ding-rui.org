This is Dingrui(Frank)'s personal website. I am a consultant working at [PricewaterhouseCoopers](https://www.pwc.com.au/). I came to Australia at 2016 and I love working and staying in Australia. I also enjoy coding and playing sports.

这里是章丁睿（Frank）的个人主页。自从2019年从[UNSW](https://https://www.unsw.edu.au/)毕业之后，目前就职于普华永道悉尼分所。我热爱R语言，喜欢折腾代码和网站。是一个高度自我驱动且闲不住的人。略好~~宅在家里~~读书， 
This Hugo theme was ported from [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy), a minimalist website generator built in Python. I don't have time to document this theme. You have to read the source code to understand what it can do. All I can say for now is that I love it. It is clean, minimal, and responsive.

I hope you will enjoy this theme. The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy). Happy hacking!
